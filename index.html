            <h2>About Form 4 Purple</h2>
            <p>
                Form 4 Purple, lovingly referred to as *Purple Lyf*, was more than just a classâ€”it was a family. 
                Our time together was marked by laughter, unity, and unforgettable memories. From group projects 
                to sports competitions, we thrived as a close-knit group that supported one another through all 
                challenges. Our shared experiences and bonds remain strong even years later.
